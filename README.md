# VoiceAssistant
This is a python application which is a voice assistant, I temporarily named my voice assistant Selena.

This allows the user to open a location on google maps, perform a google search or play a video on YouTube using voice commands. Made this program using Speech Recognition, Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) and other Python libraries.
